## About

Software development tool that lets you finally decide which framework/tooling/etc to use. By flipping a coin.

## Story

One fine day, we had to choose between Vue, React, Svelte, etc once again. These arguments took too long and we ran out of patience. 

The randomizer should be the one to decide. Unfortunately, there was no alive randomizer, that can be called in a dialog. So we made one.

## Usage

Type @coin_flips_bot in any dialog in [Telegram](https://telegram.org) and choice 'Flip a coin'.

If you want to use it directly, follow this link: [t.me/coin_flips_bot](t.me/coin_flips_bot).
